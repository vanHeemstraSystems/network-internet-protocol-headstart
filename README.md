# Network Internet Protocol (NIP) - Headstart

Based on "nip.io" at https://nip.io/

"Dead simple wildcard DNS for any IP Address."

In short, you can make your local IP address of your workstation or server public by postfixing it with "nip.io".

For example:

Your local IP (say 127.23.29.17) is private (unseen from Internet), but will have a public entrypoint (here: 127.23.29.17.nip.io) which means it is accessible from the Internet (or other public networks). Great for testing a website that is running locally, from a public URL for example.

See how to use it at "[How to manage Kubernetes & containers with Portainer](https://youtu.be/FC8pABzxZVU?t=1093) - starting at 18:10"
